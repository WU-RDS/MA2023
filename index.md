<br>
Welcome to the course **Marketing Analytics**! This course covers the conceptual foundations of data analysis techniques for marketing managers and applications of these methods to different data sets. The course will be delivered in parts using the **flipped classroom** teaching method. This means that students are required to familiarize themselves with the contents by means of **self-study** *before* each session (i.e., by going through the assigned materials on their own). This website is intended to aid the self-study process by providing you with explanations regarding the relevant concepts and methods in text and video format along with code files and commented outputs that will show you how to implement these methods using the **statistical software R**. 
<br><br>
The self-learning process will be complemented with compulsory in-person **weekly interactive sessions** in the PC lab, which provide ample opportunities to train the acquired knowledge and clarify points that require further discussion. 
<br><br>
The following pages outline the course schedule and explain how to use this tutorial in detail. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a short email.

# Introduction {-}

## Course structure {-}

This course combines asynchronous teaching elements (e.g., texts and pre-recorded videos on this website) with synchronous elements (e.g., weekly in-person interactive sessions in the PC Lab). The syllabus consists of three main parts, as reflected by the structure of this website: 

1. **Lecture notes**: the lecture part will explain the theory behind the concepts and methods and provide you with example applications using the statistical software R.
2. **Individual assignments**: the individual assignments require you to apply the acquired knowledge to new data sets.
3. **Group project**: in the group you will design and conduct your own market research project and transfer the knowledge to a real business setting.

The general approach is that students will first familiarize themselves with the contents by going through the materials on their own. This **self-study** process is complemented with in-person **weekly interactive sessions** in the PC lab, which provide ample opportunities to ask questions and clarify points that require further discussion. The schedule for each of the three parts will be explained below. 

### Schedule {-}

#### In-person lecture {-}

The contents on this website are divided into weekly readings. To be able to follow the curriculum and complete the assignments, you need to read the materials assigned for the respective week. The relevant chapters are indicated in the table below. The weekly readings will be complemented with weekly interactive sessions in the PC lab, which provide you with an opportunity to ask questions about the assigned readings. **Please note that you need to go through the materials on your own in the week before the respective session.** For example, chapters 2, 3 & 4 will be discussed in the second session. The dates and times for the classroom sessions are indicated in the table below for each group separately. It is highly recommended to prepare questions or comments about the materials for these sessions that you think might be interesting and helpful to the class. As a preparation for the in-class discussions, you should go through the **Learning check** section at the end of each chapter. By working through these questions, you may self-assess your progress and identify knowledge gaps regarding the materials that were assigned for the previous week.

::: {.infobox_red .caution data-latex="{caution}"}
We understand that the self-study format might pose challenges to the learning process because we cannot troubleshoot in person outside of the classroom sessions. Remember that it is very unlikely that you are the only student encountering a particular problem. So please make use of the forum on Learn\@WU (see below) to interact with your peers or ask us questions so that everyone else will benefit from the answer (there are no stupid questions!). In case you cannot get answers to address a specific problem, we will be available during the in-person classroom sessions for coaching.
:::

#### Individual assignments {-}

There will be 4 individual assignments complemented with optional coaching sessions. Note that the assignments need to be submitted in the [R Markdown format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (see chapter 10) via Learn\@wu. There will be a coaching session dedicated to the R Markdown reporting format in the second session, when the first homework is assigned. 

Your main point of contact for the individual assignments will be Daria Yudaeva ([daria.yudaeva@wu.ac.at](mailto:daria.yudaeva@wu.ac.at)). You may contact Daria to schedule individual coaching sessions during the times indicated in the table below. These coaching sessions will be held online. However, please make sure that you have exhausted all other resources to solve a particular problem, such as the online tutorial, the forum on Learn\@wu, and other web resources (see below) before you schedule a coaching session. If you feel that other students might have similar questions and would benefit from an answer to a particular question, you should post the question in the forum on Learn\@wu.

#### Group project {-}

The marketing research group project consists of multiple consecutive steps: 

* the design of a questionnaire
* data collection using an online survey
* data handling & data analysis
* recording of a video with a presentation of you results

We will offer coaching sessions throughout this process, providing feedback and allowing you to ask questions. The submission dates and the dates and times for the coaching sessions are summarized in the table below. 

Your main point of contact for the group project will be Daniel Winkler ([daniel.winkler@wu.ac.at](mailto:daniel.winkler@wu.ac.at)). You may contact Daniel at least one week in advance to schedule individual coaching sessions for your groups (in-person or online) during the following times:

* Thursdays 09:00AM - 05:00PM
* Fridays 01:00PM - 05:00PM

Again, please make sure that you have exhausted all other resources to solve a particular problem, such as the online tutorial, the forum on Learn\@wu, and other web resources (see below) before you schedule a coaching session. If you feel that other students might have similar questions and would benefit from an answer to a particular question, you should post the question in the forum on Learn\@wu.

### Grading {-}

Grading is based on the following components:

* **Market research group project** (questionnaire design, data collection & analysis, reporting & presentations) [weight: 30%]
* **Individual take-home computer exercises** (statistical analysis of data sets; 4 assignments accounting for 6% (A1), 8% (A2), 8% (A3), and 8% (A4)) [weight: 30%]
* **Final online exam** (concepts & methods) [weight: 30%]
* **Class participation** (quantity & quality of contributions during the weekly Q&A sessions, contributions in the online forum, etc.) [weight: 10%]

These grading components will be weighted with the respective weights to arrive at the final grade percentage.

The **final exam** will take place online at 10:00AM on December 22, 2022. The exam covers questions about the concepts and methods (no coding) and we will provide example exams from the previous years to give you an idea about what type of questions you can expect.   

To ensure an equal contribution of group members for the group assignment, a **peer assessment** will be conducted among group members, which enters into the computation of the individual grades for the project. This means that the members of a group are required to assess other students regarding their relative contribution. 

**To successfully pass this course, your weighted final grade needs to exceed 60%.**

## Course materials {-}

### Main reference {-}

The main reference for this course is this website along with the corresponding slides and the pre-recorded video lectures. The relevant materials for each week are indicated in the tables above. The aim of the materials is to condense the contents and direct your attention to the most relevant aspects. This should enable students to study the materials on their own and we can focus our attention during the classroom sessions on clarifying points that require further discussion. 

At the end of each chapter, you will find a section with references. It is highly recommended that you consult these references for further clarification in case you require additional information on a topic.

In addition to these lecture notes, there are many excellent books available (many of them for free) that focus on different aspects of R. In fact, there are so many free resources available by now that a team of R programmers has set up a website that provides an overview over the available resources by topic. You can find this overview here: [Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/).

### Discussion forum {-}

**We strongly encourage you to ask your questions via the online forum** on the course page on the WU learning platform. The purpose of the forum is to allow you to discuss questions related to the contents with your class mates and us. Please make use of this forum as much as possible and ask questions if something remained unclear. Remember that there are no stupid questions! And if you know the answer to a question that is asked in the forum, it is also a good exercise to explain the concepts to your classmates.
